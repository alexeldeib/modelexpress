# Disagg Multinode Inference Issues — GB200

**Date**: March 11, 2026 (updated)
**Cluster**: `dynamo-gcp-dev-01` (GCP GB200 NVL36, ARM64)

---

## Overview: What We've Achieved and What's Left

### Fully validated (ModelExpress P2P)
- **Aggregated TP=4**: P2P at 369 Gbps, end-to-end inference with coherent output (TTFT 3.4s)
- **DGDSA scaling**: second worker loads via P2P at 371-390 Gbps, ready in ~7.5 min
- **Disagg same-TP (TP=4+TP=4)**: both prefill and decode load concurrently at 234-538 Gbps
- **Mixed TP P2P (TP=4+TP=8)**: prefill 360-538 Gbps, decode 345-610 Gbps (8 ranks, 2 nodes)
- **Multinode source publish**: TP=8 source publishes all 8 workers correctly across 2 nodes
- **Cross-clique RoCE**: works at 345-379 Gbps (o7v→w0e)

### Infrastructure issues resolved
- **`MPI_ERR_TRUNCATE`**: Fixed with `safe_allgather` patch (chunks large MPI messages to 64KB)
- **UCX UD timeout**: Worked around with `ob1` PML
- **Multinode SSH**: Fixed with `HOME=/root`, `/run/sshd`, `HF_MODULES_CACHE`
- **Multinode rank mapping**: Fixed MPI rank vs `torch.cuda.current_device()` for source + target
- **NFS file lock (ESTALE)**: Fixed with `HF_MODULES_CACHE=/tmp/hf_modules`
- **KV cache transceiver backend**: Changed from `UCX` to `DEFAULT` (NIXL)

### Current issue: Garbage output from mixed TP disagg inference

Disagg inference pipeline runs end-to-end (prefill→KV transfer→decode→tokens), but
output is nonsensical (e.g., `"0000000000 ".format`). Multiple requests succeed
without crashing (no MPI errors, no hangs). Decode generates tokens at full speed
(~16ms/step). The issue is purely **output quality**.

**What works**: TP=4 aggregated inference produces coherent output from the same model
and same source weights. This confirms the weights are correct for TP=4.

**What's new**: This is our first time running TP=8 decode across 2 nodes. The TP=8
decode source publishes 8 workers × 90.75 GB each. The TP=8 decode target receives
all 8 shards correctly via NIXL RDMA at 365-376 Gbps.

### Investigation plan for garbage output

Two potential root causes:

**Hypothesis A: Weight transfer correctness (TP=8)**

The TP=8 weights may not be loaded correctly into the decode model, even though
the transfer completes without errors. Possible issues:
- Source publishes weights with `worker_rank` based on MPI rank, but target model
  assigns parameters to local GPU indices differently in multinode
- Weight tensor names match (same model) but the TP sharding layout at EP=8 might
  differ from EP=4 in ways that affect MoE expert assignment
- The source loaded from disk at TP=8, but TRT-LLM's weight sharding for EP=8
  may produce different parameter layouts than simply splitting EP=4 shards

**How to verify**:
1. Run TP=8 aggregated inference (non-disagg) — deploy a standalone TP=8 target
   with a frontend, verify output is coherent. If garbage, the TP=8 weights are wrong.
2. Compare parameter checksums between source and target for each rank
3. Run disagg with same TP (TP=8 prefill + TP=8 decode) to isolate mixed TP from
   the KV cache question

**Hypothesis B: KV cache format mismatch between TP=4 prefill and TP=8 decode**

The KV cache produced by TP=4 prefill (EP=4) may be incompatible with TP=8 decode (EP=8).
With `enable_attention_dp: true`, each rank computes attention independently (full heads),
so KV cache format should be TP-independent. However:
- The number of attention DP ranks differs (4 vs 8), so KV cache is distributed
  across different rank counts — the NIXL KV transceiver needs to map 4 KV shards to 8 decode ranks
- The `kv_block_size` and `tokens_per_block` settings must match between prefill and decode
- Karen's mixed TP recipe uses the same clique affinity — both prefill and decode share
  the NVLink domain, which may affect how NIXL KV transfer maps ranks

**How to verify**:
1. Run disagg with same TP=8 for both prefill and decode — if output is coherent,
   the KV cache format is the issue when TP differs
2. Check TRT-LLM docs/code for mixed EP support with NIXL KV transceiver
3. Ask TRT-LLM team if `enable_attention_dp: true` guarantees KV cache compatibility
   across different EP sizes

### Priority
1. Test TP=8 aggregated inference first (verifies weight correctness)
2. If weights are correct, test same-TP disagg (TP=8+TP=8) to isolate KV cache
3. If KV cache is the issue, align prefill and decode to same TP or ask TRT-LLM team

## Resolved Issues

### Issue 1 (RESOLVED): MPI_ERR_TRUNCATE with ob1 PML

**Symptom**: During inference, `tp_gather` → `comm.allgather` fails with `MPI_ERR_TRUNCATE: message truncated` on the decode TP=8 multinode worker.

**Call stack**:
```
py_executor._executor_loop
  → _handle_first_token_response
    → _enqueue_responses
      → dist.tp_gather
        → safe_gather → comm.allgather
          → MPI_ERR_TRUNCATE
```

**Root cause**: `OMPI_MCA_pml=ob1` + `OMPI_MCA_btl=tcp,self,vader` forces MPI to use TCP BTL for cross-node communication. TCP BTL has a fixed max message size (~128KB default). TRT-LLM's `allgather` sends pickled Python response objects that exceed this limit.

**Why we need ob1**: Without it, UCX PML discovers IB/UD devices via `privileged: true` and hits a **UCX UD endpoint timeout** during MPI bootstrap on GB200 — a known hardware/driver issue.

**What we tried**:

| Config | Result |
|--------|--------|
| `ob1` + `tcp,self,vader` | P2P works (370+ Gbps), inference truncates |
| `ob1` + `tcp,self,vader` + `btl_tcp_max_send_size=1MB` | MPI session hung |
| No OMPI overrides + `privileged: true` | MPI init hangs (UCX UD timeout) |
| No OMPI overrides + `runAsUser: 0` | MPI works, NIXL TCP only (~3 Gbps) |
| `UCX_TLS=tcp,self,sm` + `privileged: true` | MpiSession hangs |
| `UCX_TLS=tcp,cuda_ipc,cuda_copy,self,sm` + `privileged: true` | MpiSession hangs |
| No env overrides, let operator handle MPI | `btl_tcp_endpoint` process ID mismatch |

**How Karen avoids this**: Uses `runAsUser: 0` (not privileged) — UCX never sees IB devices, NCCL handles TP collectives via NVIDIA driver, MPI only does small bootstrap messages.

---

### Issue 2 (RESOLVED): UCX_TLS conflict between MPI and NIXL

**Symptom**: Setting `UCX_TLS=tcp` globally (to fix MPI) also restricts NIXL to TCP, dropping P2P from 370 Gbps to ~3 Gbps.

**Root cause**: `UCX_TLS` is a process-wide env var. Both MPI's UCX PML and NIXL's UCX agent read it. We need MPI on TCP but NIXL on RoCE.

**Fix implemented (v1.6.0)**: In `nixl_transfer.py`, NIXL temporarily removes `UCX_TLS=tcp` before creating its agent, then restores it. Supports `NIXL_UCX_TLS` env var for explicit override.

```python
# In NixlTransferManager.initialize():
saved_ucx_tls = os.environ.get("UCX_TLS")
if saved_ucx_tls == "tcp":
    os.environ.pop("UCX_TLS", None)  # let NIXL auto-detect RoCE
try:
    self._agent = NixlAgent(self._agent_name, config)
finally:
    os.environ["UCX_TLS"] = saved_ucx_tls  # restore for MPI
```

**Status**: Built in v1.6.0 image, deployed but pending cluster scheduling. Untested end-to-end.

---

### Issue 3 (RESOLVED): KV Cache Transceiver UCX Connection

**Symptom**: `CacheReceiver` can't connect to prefill's UCX port for KV cache transfer:
```
Error in addConnection(ip) for rank 1 ip: 10.0.15.220 port: 33879
Error in UcxConnection constructor: Request canceled
```

**Root cause**: The `cache_transceiver_config: backend: UCX` creates its own UCX connections between prefill and decode pods for KV cache transfer. With our config, UCX connectivity between the prefill (w0e) and decode (w0e) pods isn't establishing properly.

**Karen's working config**: Both prefill and decode in the same DGD, same clique, `runAsUser: 0`, no UCX_TLS overrides. UCX auto-detects and connects.

**Status**: Not investigated in depth. Secondary to MPI issue.

---

### Issue 4 (RESOLVED): Compute Domain / DRA Scheduling

**Symptom**: Target pods stuck in `Pending` — "cannot allocate all claims" or "node is unschedulable".

**Root cause**: Each node's IMEX channel can only serve one compute domain (`allocationMode: Single`). With Karen's pods, Sara's NCCL test, and our source pods consuming channels, not enough free nodes remain in the clique.

**Workarounds**:
- Move targets to w0e pool (partially worked — 4 free nodes)
- Remove clique affinity between source and target (cross-clique RoCE works at 345-379 Gbps)
- Ask other users to clean up idle compute domains

---

### Issue 5 (RESOLVED): NFS File Lock (ESTALE) on Multinode

**Symptom**: Ranks 4-7 on node B crash with `[Errno 116] Stale file handle` during model config loading.

**Root cause**: TRT-LLM's `config_file_lock()` uses Python `filelock` on the shared NFS PVC. Cross-node NFS locking (NFSv3 NLM) is unreliable.

**Fix**: `HF_MODULES_CACHE=/tmp/hf_modules` moves the lock file to local disk. From coworker's investigation — 100% failure rate with filelock on NFS, 0% on local disk.

**Status**: Fixed.

---

### Issue 6 (RESOLVED): Multinode SSH / sshd

**Symptom**: Worker pod CrashLoopBackOff — `sshd: no hostkeys available` or `Missing privilege separation directory`.

**Root cause**: DGD operator's SSH key gen script uses `~` which resolves to `/home/dynamo` (image USER), but sshd runs as root and looks in `/root/.ssh/`.

**Fixes**:
- `HOME=/root` env var
- `/run/sshd` directory with `chmod 0755` + `chown root:root` in Dockerfile

**Status**: Fixed in v1.6.0 image.

## What Works

| Scenario | P2P Speed | Inference | Status |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Aggregated TP=4 (single node) | 369 Gbps | Works | **VALIDATED** |
| DGDSA scale 1→2 (single node) | 371-390 Gbps | Works | **VALIDATED** |
| Disagg same-TP TP=4+TP=4 | 234-538 Gbps | KV transceiver issue | P2P validated |
| Mixed TP prefill TP=4 (single node) | 360-393 Gbps | Works (standalone) | **VALIDATED** |
| Mixed TP decode TP=8 (multinode) | 345-479 Gbps | MPI_ERR_TRUNCATE | P2P validated |
| Cross-clique RoCE (o7v→w0e) | 345-379 Gbps | — | **Works** |
| TP=8 source multinode publish | 8 workers published | — | **VALIDATED** |

---

## Approaches to Fix Multinode Inference

### Option A: `runAsUser: 0` for decode (immediate workaround)
- Use Karen's config: `runAsUser: 0`, no OMPI/UCX overrides
- MPI works, NCCL handles TP via NVIDIA driver, KV cache NIXL works
- P2P falls back to TCP (~3 Gbps) — 90.75 GB in ~4 min (still 8x faster than disk)
- **Pros**: Zero code changes, proven by Karen
- **Cons**: No RoCE for decode P2P. Prefill (single-node) still gets RoCE.
- **Status**: Ready to deploy

### Option B: Add `safe_allgather` to TRT-LLM (recommended upstream fix)
- **The actual bug**: `tp_allgather` uses raw `comm.allgather(obj)` without chunking.
  `safe_gather` already exists with `chunk_size=4MB`, but `tp_allgather` bypasses it.
- **File**: `tensorrt_llm/_torch/distributed/communicator.py` line 545
- **Current code**: `return self.tp_comm.allgather(obj)` — no size limit
- **Fix**: Route through chunked allgather (like `safe_gather`), or use
  `torch.distributed.all_gather_object` which handles large messages natively
- **Pros**: Minimal change, fixes ob1 truncation without changing executor
- **Cons**: Requires TRT-LLM upstream PR
- **Status**: Not implemented. Filed as suggestion.

```python
# Suggested fix in MPIDist (communicator.py):
def tp_allgather(self, obj):
    # Use safe chunked allgather instead of raw comm.allgather
    return safe_allgather(self.tp_comm, obj, chunk_size=64 * 1024)
```

### Option C: `TLLM_DISABLE_MPI=1` (needs Ray)
- TRT-LLM has `TLLM_DISABLE_MPI=1` → switches from `MPIDist` to `TorchDist` (NCCL)
- **Problem**: Also switches executor from MPI-based to **Ray-based**
- Requires Ray installed + Ray-based launch (not compatible with operator's `mpirun`)
- **Tested**: Crashes with `ModuleNotFoundError: Cannot import Ray`
- **Pros**: Would completely solve MPI issues
- **Cons**: Different launch paradigm, needs Ray in image + operator support
- **Status**: Tested, not viable with current operator

### Option D: NIXL UCX_TLS override (implemented)
- `UCX_TLS=tcp` globally for MPI
- NIXL temporarily removes it during agent creation → auto-detects RoCE
- `IPC_LOCK` + `SYS_RESOURCE` capabilities (not privileged)
- **Problem**: operator's `mpirun -x UCX_TLS=tcp` re-sets env in worker processes,
  so NIXL override doesn't take effect in multinode workers
- **Pros**: Clean concept, works for single-node
- **Cons**: Doesn't work with `mpirun -x` env propagation
- **Status**: Built in v1.6.0, doesn't work for multinode

### Option E: NIXL per-context UCX config (NIXL team)
- NIXL C++ backend supports `engine_config` with `TLS=rc_v,rc_x,...`
- Python API (`nixl_agent_config`) doesn't expose this yet
- **Fix**: Add `ucx_engine_config` param to Python `nixl_agent_config`:
  ```python
  config = nixl_agent_config(
      backends=["UCX"],
      ucx_engine_config="TLS=rc_v,rc_x,rc,dc_x,dc,cuda_copy,tcp"
  )
  ```
- This would override UCX_TLS at the NIXL context level, immune to `mpirun -x`
- **Pros**: Proper isolation, works with any MPI config
- **Cons**: Requires NIXL Python API change (C++ already supports it)
- **Status**: Not implemented. File as NIXL feature request.

### Option F: Fix UCX UD timeout on GB200
- Root cause fix in UCX/driver for IB UD transport timeout
- Would allow default UCX PML to work with `privileged: true`
- **Pros**: Fixes everything at the source
- **Cons**: Hardware/driver issue, not in our control
- **Status**: Known issue, no ETA

### Option G: Sara's pattern — `IPC_LOCK` + `UCX_TLS=tcp` + NCCL built-in IB
- From [k8s-nccl-test B200](https://github.com/sara4dev/k8s-nccl-test/tree/b200)
- `UCX_TLS=tcp` for MPI, NCCL uses built-in IB transport (not UCX)
- `IPC_LOCK` + `SYS_RESOURCE` capabilities for RDMA memory registration
- **Tested**: MPI works, but NIXL also gets `UCX_TLS=tcp` (no RoCE)
- Same issue as Option D — global UCX_TLS affects NIXL
- **Status**: Tested, NIXL falls back to TCP

---

## Recommendation Priority

1. **Immediate**: Option A (`runAsUser: 0`) — get end-to-end inference working today
2. **Short-term**: Option B (TRT-LLM `safe_allgather`) — one PR to TRT-LLM, fixes everything
3. **Medium-term**: Option E (NIXL `ucx_engine_config`) — proper RoCE isolation for NIXL
4. **Long-term**: Option F (fix UCX UD on GB200) — root cause, eliminates all workarounds

## Configuration Reference

### What works for P2P weight transfer (all scenarios):
```yaml
securityContext:
  privileged: true
env:
  UCX_TLS: "rc_v,rc_x,rc,dc_x,dc,cuda_ipc,cuda_copy,tcp"
  OMPI_MCA_pml: "ob1"
  OMPI_MCA_btl: "tcp,self,vader"
```

### What works for single-node inference (TP=4):
```yaml
securityContext:
  privileged: true
env:
  UCX_TLS: "rc_v,rc_x,rc,dc_x,dc,cuda_copy,tcp"  # NO cuda_ipc
  OMPI_MCA_pml: "ob1"
  OMPI_MCA_btl: "tcp,self,vader"
```

### What works for multinode inference (Karen's approach, no RoCE P2P):
```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsUser: 0
# No UCX_TLS, no OMPI_MCA overrides
# NCCL handles TP collectives via NVIDIA driver
# P2P falls back to TCP (~3 Gbps)
```

### What works for multinode P2P + startup (not inference):
```yaml
securityContext:
  privileged: true
env:
  UCX_TLS: "rc_v,rc_x,rc,dc_x,dc,cuda_ipc,cuda_copy,tcp"
  OMPI_MCA_pml: "ob1"
  OMPI_MCA_btl: "tcp,self,vader"
# P2P at 370-610 Gbps, autotuning works, inference hits MPI_ERR_TRUNCATE
```

### What we tried and failed:

| Config | P2P | MPI Init | Inference | Why it failed |
|--------|-----|----------|-----------|---------------|
| `privileged` + `ob1` + TCP BTL | RoCE 370+ Gbps | Works | `MPI_ERR_TRUNCATE` | TCP BTL can't handle large allgather |
| `privileged` + no OMPI overrides | N/A | Hangs | N/A | UCX UD timeout on GB200 |
| `runAsUser: 0` + no overrides | TCP ~3 Gbps | Works | Works (Karen) | No RoCE without IB devices |
| `IPC_LOCK` + `UCX_TLS=tcp` | TCP ~3 Gbps | Works | Untested | NIXL also gets TCP |
| `TLLM_DISABLE_MPI=1` | N/A | N/A | Ray not installed | Switches to Ray executor |
| `UCX_TLS=tcp,cuda_ipc,...` + `privileged` | N/A | Hangs | N/A | UCX confused by visible IB |
| No env overrides + operator mpirun | N/A | `btl_tcp` errors | N/A | Process ID mismatch |
| `runAsUser:0` + `IPC_LOCK` + no OMPI env | N/A | Inner MpiSession hangs | N/A | TRT-LLM's internal MPI picks `169.254.x.x` link-local |
| `runAsUser:0` + `OMPI_MCA_*` env + no UCX fixes | Weights matched 1154/1815 | MPI works | `NIXL_ERR_BACKEND` | NIXL `loadRemoteMD` connects to `169.254.4.6` |
| `runAsUser:0` + `OMPI_MCA_*` + `UCX_NET_DEVICES=eth0` | Same | MPI works | `NIXL_ERR_BACKEND` | Source published metadata with `169.254.4.6` baked in |

### Issue #7: NIXL source address bound to link-local `169.254.x.x`
**Status**: INVESTIGATING — needs source redeployment with `UCX_NET_DEVICES=eth0`

The source's `nixl_transfer.py` temporarily removes `UCX_TLS` for NIXL agent creation to auto-detect
RoCE. However, without `UCX_NET_DEVICES=eth0`, the NIXL agent binds to ALL interfaces including
`169.254.x.x` link-local addresses. This address gets baked into the metadata published to Redis.
When target pods try to `add_remote_agent(source_metadata)`, NIXL/UCX attempts to connect to
`169.254.4.6` which is unreachable from other pods.

**Fix**: Add `UCX_NET_DEVICES=eth0` to source DGD YAML, flush Redis, and redeploy.

**Key learnings from this debugging session (multinode disagg + MX P2P)**:
1. Inner MPI session (`start MpiSession with 8 workers`) needs `OMPI_MCA_pml=ob1` + `btl_tcp_if_include=eth0` as **env vars** (not just mpirun flags)
2. `UCX_TCP_IF_INCLUDE` is NOT a valid UCX env var (UCX warns "unused")
3. `UCX_NET_DEVICES=eth0,eth2,eth3,eth4,eth5` is the correct way to restrict UCX interface selection (exclude 169.254.x.x link-local)
4. Source NIXL metadata contains the transport address — must be routable from target pods
5. Karen's disagg recipe works without MX P2P because it loads from shared PVC directly
6. DGD operator exports env vars via mpirun `-x` from `collectAllEnvVars()` — includes all vars set in container env spec
7. MoE backend must match between source and target (TRTLLM vs WIDEEP causes garbage output)
8. `MX_TRANSFER_TIMEOUT` env var added (default 900s) — TCP transfers of 90 GB can exceed the old 300s hardcoded timeout

### Issue #8: RoCE not activating despite correct config
**Status**: RESOLVED — UCX_IB_GID_INDEX=3 was the missing piece

**Fix**: `UCX_TLS=self,sm,rc,cuda_copy,gdr_copy,tcp` + `UCX_IB_GID_INDEX=3` + `TRTLLM_UCX_INTERFACE=eth0`
**Result**: 360-430 Gbps RoCE across all 8 ranks (90.75 GB in 1.69-2.02s per rank)

UCX selects TCP even with all correct config:
- `privileged: true`, `ulimit -l unlimited`
- `UCX_TLS=rc_v,rc_x,rc,dc_x,dc,cuda_copy,cuda_ipc,tcp` propagated to MPI workers
- `UCX_NET_DEVICES=eth0,eth2,eth3,eth4,eth5`
- IB devices active (`ibv_devinfo` shows `PORT_ACTIVE`)
- UCX loads `libuct_ib_mlx5.so` and `libuct_rdmacm.so`
- All 4 mlx5 devices visible

UCX wireup logs show `tcp/eth4` on all lanes with `software emulation`.
Previous TP=4 aggregated test (plain Deployment, not DGD) achieved 369 Gbps RoCE on same nodes.

## RoCE Debug Plan

### Problem Summary
Two NIXL users in the same process need different UCX transport configs:
1. **MX P2P weight transfer** (modelexpress `nixl_transfer.py`) — wants RoCE for fast weight transfer
2. **TRT-LLM KV cache transceiver** (C++ `NixlTransferAgent`) — needs TCP-safe config for prefill↔decode

Setting `UCX_TLS` with RoCE globally breaks TRT-LLM's KV cache NIXL (hangs on inference).
Setting `UCX_TLS=tcp` globally limits weight transfer to ~3-4 Gbps.

### Root Causes Identified

#### RC1: TRT-LLM `getAvailableIP()` picks `169.254.x.x`
**Repo**: `TensorRT-LLM`
**File**: `cpp/tensorrt_llm/executor/cache_transmission/nixl_utils/transferAgent.cpp:119-158`

`getAvailableIP()` iterates interfaces and returns the FIRST IPv4 address, only skipping
`docker*` and `lo`. Does NOT skip link-local `169.254.x.x`. With `hostNetwork: true` on
GB200 nodes, `169.254.x.x` appears before `eth0` and gets baked into the NIXL agent address.

**Fix**: Set `TRTLLM_UCX_INTERFACE=eth0` env var (checked at line 125-129 via `getEnvNixlInterface()`).
This forces TRT-LLM's KV cache NIXL to bind to `eth0` specifically.

#### RC2: UCX selects TCP even with RC transports requested
**Repo**: UCX / NIXL
**Evidence**: `UCX_TLS=rc_v,rc_x,...,tcp`, `privileged: true`, `ulimit -l unlimited`,
`ibv_devinfo` shows `PORT_ACTIVE`, UCX loads `libuct_ib_mlx5.so` — yet wireup selects `tcp/ethX`.

**Hypotheses**:
- (a) UCX `rc_v`/`rc_x` requires explicit `rdma/ib` Kubernetes resource requests
  (Sara's NCCL test uses `rdma/ib: "8"` resource limit)
- (b) NIXL's UCX agent config overrides transport selection
  (`nixlAgentConfig` may force TCP internally)
- (c) GKE container runtime blocks IB verbs even with `privileged: true`
  (need to test `ibv_rc_pingpong` inside the pod)
- (d) Missing GDRCopy or CUDA IPC configuration for GPU-direct RDMA

#### RC3: Two NIXL agents share same UCX process context
**Repos**: `modelexpress` + `TensorRT-LLM`

Our `nixl_transfer.py` temporarily overrides `UCX_TLS` before creating the MX NIXL agent,
then restores it. But UCX caches transport resources per-process — the first agent's context
affects the second. TRT-LLM creates its KV cache NIXL agent later in the same process.

### Debug Plan

#### Phase 1: Isolate UCX RC transport (standalone test in DGD pod)
**Goal**: Determine if UCX RC verbs work at all inside a DGD-managed pod
**Repos**: None (manual test)

```bash
# Exec into decode leader pod
kubectl exec -it <decode-ldr-pod> -c main -- bash

# Test 1: IB verbs directly
ibv_rc_pingpong -d mlx5_0 -g 0  # Run on source node
ibv_rc_pingpong -d mlx5_0 -g 0 <source-ip>  # Run on target node

# Test 2: UCX perftest with RC
ucx_perftest -t tag_bw -m cuda -s 1048576  # Server on source
ucx_perftest <source-ip> -t tag_bw -m cuda -s 1048576  # Client on target

# Test 3: Check UCX transport availability
ucx_info -d | grep -i "rc_mlx5\|rc_v\|Transport"
```

#### Phase 2: Fix TRT-LLM KV cache NIXL interface binding
**Goal**: TRT-LLM KV cache NIXL binds to `eth0`, not `169.254.x.x`
**Repo**: `TensorRT-LLM`
**File**: `cpp/tensorrt_llm/executor/cache_transmission/nixl_utils/transferAgent.cpp`

- **Quick fix**: Add `TRTLLM_UCX_INTERFACE=eth0` to DGD YAML env vars
- **Proper fix**: `getAvailableIP()` should skip link-local addresses (`169.254.x.x`)
  Add check: `if (strncmp(address_buffer, "169.254.", 8) == 0) continue;`

#### Phase 3: Add `rdma/ib` resource requests
**Goal**: Ensure RDMA device plugin properly allocates IB devices to pods
**Repo**: `modelexpress` (YAML configs) + `dynamo` (operator)

Sara's NCCL test uses `rdma/ib: "8"` in resource limits. Our DGD YAMLs don't request
this resource. The RDMA shared device plugin may not expose IB devices properly without it.

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    gpu: "4"
    rdma/ib: "4"   # <-- add this
```

Check if `rdma/ib` resource is available: `kubectl describe node <gpu-node> | grep rdma`

#### Phase 4: NIXL agent UCX context isolation
**Goal**: MX P2P NIXL uses RoCE, TRT-LLM KV cache NIXL uses TCP, independently
**Repos**: `modelexpress` + `nixl`

Options:
- (a) **NIXL agent-level transport config**: Check if `nixlAgentConfig` supports
  per-agent `UCX_TLS` override (not env var based). Look at NIXL's `_api.py` and
  `nixl_agent.cpp` for backend config params.
- (b) **Process isolation**: Run MX P2P transfer in a subprocess with different
  UCX env vars, then exit. TRT-LLM's NIXL agent creates in the main process
  with TCP config afterward.
- (c) **Sequential override**: Ensure MX NIXL agent is created and transfer
  completes BEFORE TRT-LLM creates its KV cache NIXL agent. Currently both
  happen inside `LLM()` constructor — weight load (our NIXL) then executor
  setup (TRT-LLM NIXL).

#### Phase 5: Dynamo operator env var propagation audit
**Goal**: Ensure all UCX/NIXL env vars reach MPI workers
**Repo**: `dynamo`
**File**: `deploy/operator/internal/dynamo/backend_trtllm.go:251-278`

`collectAllEnvVars()` already includes all container env vars in mpirun `-x` flags.
Verified working. Add `TRTLLM_UCX_INTERFACE` to the common vars list for convenience:

```go
func getCommonTRTLLMEnvVars() map[string]bool {
    return map[string]bool{
        // ... existing vars ...
        "TRTLLM_USE_UCX_KVCACHE": true,
        "TRTLLM_UCX_INTERFACE": true,  // <-- add
        "UCX_TLS": true,               // <-- add
        "UCX_NET_DEVICES": true,       // <-- add
    }
}
```

### Immediate Next Steps (priority order)

1. **Set `TRTLLM_UCX_INTERFACE=eth0`** in DGD YAML → fixes KV cache NIXL `169.254.x.x` → allows RoCE `UCX_TLS` without breaking inference
2. **Revert to `UCX_TLS=tcp` + test inference** → validate MoE backend fix produces correct output
3. **Run `ibv_rc_pingpong` inside DGD pod** → confirm IB verbs work at all
4. **Check `rdma/ib` resource** → may be required for proper RDMA device exposure
5. **Test with `TRTLLM_UCX_INTERFACE=eth0` + RoCE `UCX_TLS`** → should fix both issues simultaneously
